**Had better** is a modal verb that is used to give advice or suggestions in a specific situation.

The verb form is **always had, not have**, and ==**it is followed by the infinitive without to**==. We normally shorten it to **'d better** in informal situations. For example:

- **You’d better hurry up** or you’ll miss the bus.
- **They’d better pay their bills** on time or they’ll face a penalty.

In spoken English we normally use the short form **‘d better**. And in informal speech, people sometimes say just **better** (without **had**).

- **You better** go home.
- **I better** get it right this time.
