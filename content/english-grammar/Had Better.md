**Had better** is a modal verb that is used to give advice or suggestions in a specific situation. The verb form is always had, not have, and **it is followed by the infinitive without to**. We normally shorten it to **'d better** in informal situations. For example:

- You’d better hurry up or you’ll miss the bus. (If you don’t hurry up, you’ll miss the bus.)
- They’d better pay their bills on time or they’ll face a penalty. (If they don’t pay their bills on time, they’ll face a penalty.)

In spoken English we normally use the short form **‘d better**. And in informal speech, people sometimes say just **better** (without **had**).

- You better go home.
- I better get it right this time.
