These four expressions (Suppose, Supposing, Imagine, What if) are interchangeable with "if" in conditional sentences. Simply substitute "if" with any of these expressions while maintaining the structure of the original "if" clause.

We use the [[present tense]] to describe real situations, as seen in the [[first conditional]].

- **Imagine** you **meet** him in the street, what **are you going to tell** him? (First)

We use the [[past simple]] or [[past perfect]] tenses to describe hypothetical or counterfactual situations, like those seen in the [[second conditional|second]], [[third conditional|third]], and [[mixed conditional|mixed conditionals]].

- **What if** you **found** a suitcase full of money? What **would** you do? (Second)
- **Supposing** she **hadn't told** you anything, you would have acted differently. (Third)
