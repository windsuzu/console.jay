These four expressions (Suppose, Supposing, Imagine, What if) are interchangeable with "if" in conditional sentences. Simply substitute "if" with any of these expressions while maintaining the structure of the original "if" clause.

We use the [[present tense]] to describe real situations, as seen in the [[first conditional]].

- **Imagine** you **meet** him in the street, what are you going to tell him?
