The expressions "Suppose," "Supposing," "Imagine," and "What if" can sometimes be used interchangeably with "if" in conditional sentences. However, they each carry slightly different shades of meaning and emphasis.

We use the [[present tense]] to describe real situations, as seen in the [[first conditional]].

```py
Imagine you meet him in the street, what are you going to tell him?
        ^condition (present)                 ^result (future)
```

We use the [[past simple]] or [[past perfect]] tenses to describe hypothetical or counterfactual situations, like those seen in the [[second conditional|second]], [[third conditional|third]], and [[mixed conditional|mixed conditionals]].

```py
What if you found a suitcase full of money? What would you do?
        ^condition (2nd)                    ^result (2nd)

Supposing she hadn't told you anything, you would have acted differently.
          ^condition (3rd)              ^result (3rd)
```
