**What are prepositions of place?** They are used to indicate the relationship between an object and its location. We use just three key prepositions: **in**, **on**, and **at**.

In: This preposition indicates something being contained within a closed space or area.

Example: The book is in the drawer.
On: This preposition indicates something being placed on the surface of something else.

Example: The vase is on the table.
At: This preposition has a wider range of uses related to location, but in the context of object-place relationship, it often signifies a specific point or position.

Example: The meeting is at 10:00 AM in the conference room (combining "in" for the enclosed space and "at" for the specific time).
