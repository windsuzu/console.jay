## Have something done

 We use the construction `have + something + past participle` to indicate that someone else performs an action for us.

```py
# By ourselves
We clean the house every Friday.

# By someone else
We have the house cleaned every Friday.
```

>[!example]
>- I am going to **have my hair cut** tomorrow.
>- She is **having her house redecorated**.
>- He **had his wallet stolen**. 
## Have someone do

In addition, the construction `have + person + infinitive` allows us to **specify who performs an action for us**.

```py
# No specifying person
We're having the ground floor redesigned.

# Specifying the person
We're having the architect redesign the ground floor.
             ^person       ^infinitive
```

>[!tip] Caveats
>In this construction, `have` functions as a main verb, **not an auxiliary**. Use `do/did` for negative and question sentences.
>- We **donâ€™t** usually have the house painted.
>- **Did** you have your house painted?
