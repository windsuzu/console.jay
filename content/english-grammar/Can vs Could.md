Both "can" and "could" can be used for requests, but "could" adds a layer of politeness and indirectness, making it more appropriate in formal or sensitive situations.

Think of "could" as ==testing the waters â€“ you're open to their answer==, maybe even expecting they might be busy. "Can" jumps right in, assuming they're ready to lend a hand.

```py
Can you help me with this problem?
= less polite, 
= because you are expecting the person to help you

Could you help me with this problem? 
= more polite, 
= because you are not sure if the person wants to help you
```

> [!tip]
> The past simple tense can sometimes be used to **soften** or **indirectly** express requests or suggestions, making them sound more **polite** than using the present tense. This is because the past simple can create a sense of **hypotheticality** or **uncertainty**, even if the situation being referred to is actually real or certain.
