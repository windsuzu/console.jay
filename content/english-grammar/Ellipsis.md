**What is ellipsis?** It allows you to omit repeated subjects, verbs, or phrases under certain conditions. It is recommended to use **auxiliary verbs (do/does/did)** to reduce repetition in the second clause.

>[!example] Remove repeated subject
>- He closed the door **and** ~~he~~ **took off** his shoes.
>- We could go out **or** ~~we could~~ **have** a party at home.
>- She called **but** ~~she~~ **didn’t leave** a message. 

>[!example] Repeat only auxiliary or modal verb
>- Maria should take the exam, but I don’t think you **should** ~~take the exam~~.
>- She’ll go to the meeting but I **won’t** ~~go to the meeting~~. 
>- They say he is the best right now, but I don’t think he **is** ~~the best~~.
>- She doesn’t like it, but I **do**.
>- She liked it, but I **didn’t**.  

>[!example] Reduced Infinitive
>- I shouldn’t go out tonight, but I really **want to** ~~go out~~. 
>- Are you going to sell the car?’ ‘No, I‘ve decided **not to** ~~sell the car~~.
