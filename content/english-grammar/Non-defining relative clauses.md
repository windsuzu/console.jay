Non-defining relative clauses ==**add details, not essential,**== about the person or thing we are discussing. They are **usually set off by commas**.

>[!example]
>- This music, **which I really like**, was used at the show.
>- My sister, **who I truly admire**, is coming for Thanksgiving. 

In non-defining relative clauses, `who` and `which` cannot be replaced with `that` or omitted.

>[!example]
>- This music, ~~that I really like~~, was used at the show. ❌
>- This music, **which I really like**, was used at the show. ✅
>- My sister, ~~I truly admire~~, is coming for Thanksgiving. ❌
>- My sister, **whom I truly admire**, is coming for Thanksgiving. ✅
