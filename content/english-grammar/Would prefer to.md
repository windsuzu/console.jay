Similar to "[[would rather]]", we use `(would) prefer` + `to infinitive` or `noun` to show our specific preference.

>[!example]
>- I **would prefer to** **stay** in a hotel near the airport.
>- Most clients **prefer to have** breakfast in their bedroom.
>- I **prefer** **brown** **sugar** to white sugar.

To express different choices, you can use either `rather than + infinitive` or `instead of V-ing` depending on the context.

>[!example]
>- I **would prefer to be** too early **rather than be** too late. 
>- I **prefer to go** with dad **instead of staying** here with mum.

The phrase `prefer + V-ing` comes in handy when we want to talk about preferences that apply in most cases, like our usual go-to activities.

>[!example] 
>- I love running, but he **prefers cycling**. 

To convey the different choices at hand, utilize the `prefer + V-ing + to + V-ing` format.

>[!example] 
>- He prefers walking **to cycling**. 
>- I prefer sitting in the back **to sitting in the front**.
