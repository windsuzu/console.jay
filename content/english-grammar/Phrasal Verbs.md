A phrasal verb consists of a verb with one or more particles (prepositions or adverbs). In other words, Verb + particle(s) = **phrasal verb**.

Here are some examples of phrasal verbs with 1 particle:
- wake + up = **wake up**
- sit + down = **sit down**
- throw + away = **throw away**
- pick + up = **pick up**
- take + off = **take off**

Here are some examples of phrasal verbs with 2 particles:
- look + forward to = **look forward to**
- get + on with = **get on with**

Phrasal verbs have some variations, such as [[Transitive and Intransitive Phrasal Verbs]], and can also be categorized further into [[Transitive and Intransitive Phrasal Verbs|Separable and Inseparable Verbs]].
