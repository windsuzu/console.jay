## Intransitive phrasal verb
An intransitive phrasal verb **doesn't require any direct object** to complete its meaning. For example:

- He **slept**.
- She **laughed**.
- They **danced**.

## Transitive phrasal verb
A transitive phrasal verb **requires an object** to complete its meaning. For example:

- She **turned off** the TV.
- You **put** it **on**.
- I **took** them **off**.

### Separable and Inseparable
Some transitive phrasal verbs can have the object between the verb and the particle, or after the particle. For example:

- She **turned off** the TV. ✅
- She **turned** the TV **off**. ✅

Some transitive phrasal verbs can only have the object after the particle, **especially when the object is a pronoun**. 

- He **explained the problem** to me. ✅
- He explained me the problem. ❌

When we replace the object with a pronoun, we must place the pronoun between the verb and the particle.

- You **put** it **on**. ✅
- You put on it. ❌
- I **took** them **off**. ✅
- I took off them. ❌
