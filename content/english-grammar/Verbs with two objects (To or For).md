**Verbs with two objects** are verbs that can take both a [[Direct and Indirect Object|direct object and an indirect object]] in the same sentence. 

In a sentence, **the direct object** bears the brunt of the verb's action, while **the indirect object** reaps the benefit or receives the direct object. For example:

```
She gave him a book

a book = direct object
   him = indirect object
```

There are **two types of structures** when using verbs with two objects:
- She gave him a book. (verb + indirect object + direct object)
- She gave a book to him. (verb + direct object + preposition + indirect object)

## To or For?
The choice of “to” or “for” depends on the meaning and the verb that is used. Generally, we use “to” when the indirect object is the receiver of the direct object, and we use “for” when the indirect object is the beneficiary of the direct object. 

For example, we say “He sent a letter to his friend” because his friend is the one who received the letter. But we say “He bought a gift for his friend” because his friend is the one who benefited from the gift.
