Occasionally, we encounter **compound nouns**: two nouns joined together to create a new meaning. In these cases, the first noun modifies the second, like an adjective, replacing the need for the possessive form ([['s and of]]). For instance:

> [!example] Compound nouns with two separate words
> - School bus
> - Car park
> - Bus stop
> - Car key
> - Ice cream

> [!example] Compound nouns used as one word
> - toothpaste
> - haircut
> - bathroom

>[!example] Compound nouns linked with a hyphen
>- letter-box
>- dry-cleaning
>- father-in-law

## Containers

We often use compound nouns to refer to a container, which is usually empty, such as **a tea cup, a wine glass, a beer glass, a matchbox, etc.**

>[!example]
> - Can you pass me those **tea cups**? 
> - She keeps the insects that she catches in that **matchbox**. 

And we use `noun + of + noun` more often to refer to a container with its content. For example: **a cup of tea, a glass of wine, a glass of beer, a box of matches, etc.**

>[!example]
>- Would you like **a cup of tea**? 
>- Do you have **a box of matches**? I need to light this candle.
