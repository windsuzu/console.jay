**Stative verbs**, also known as **non-action verbs**, cannot be used in the present continuous tense; they can only be used in present simple sentences. There are four categories of stative verbs:

## 1. Verbs of the senses
(hear, smell, look, seem, sound)
- **Look** at her; she **seems** sad.
## 2. Verbs of opinion
(believe, consider, like, love, hate, prefer)
- I **believe** he **likes** her.
## 3. Verbs of possession
(own, belong)
- This is where I **belong**.
## 4. Others
(agree, be, depend, need, mean, remember, realise, recognise, seem, want)
- Please, give me my money; I **need** it now.

But there are some verbs that have both **dynamic** and **stative** meaning. For example, **have**, **think**, or **see**.
- I **have** a car (=possession) / I **am having** a siesta (=action)
- I **think** he is great (=opinion) / What are you **thinking**? (=action)
- I **am seeing** the doctor tomorrow at 9. (see= ‘have an appointment’)
- What do you **see** in this picture? (see= ‘see with your eyes’)
