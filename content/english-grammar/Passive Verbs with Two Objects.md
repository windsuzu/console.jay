Some verbs can function as **[[Verbs with two objects|verbs with two object]]**, meaning they take two objects. Common examples include **bring, get, give, make, offer, promise, send, and show**.

With these verbs, you can **transform either the direct object or the indirect object into the subject** of the sentence. For example, active sentences can be rephrased into passive sentences as shown below:

```py
# Active sentence
I sent my friends a picture. 
= I sent a picture to my friends.

# Passive sentence
(Start with indirect object) 
My friends were sent a picture.

(Start with direct object)
A picture were sent to my friends.
```

> [!tip]
> It is more common to begin the passive sentence with the person: ***My friends were sent a picture.***
