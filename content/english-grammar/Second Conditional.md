The second conditional explores **improbable ==present or future== scenarios**. It asks, "What if things were different?" like a thought experiment.

> [!important] First vs Second Conditional
> We use the **[[first conditional]]** to talk about **possible** future situations and we use the **second conditional** to talk about **hypothetical** or **imaginary** future situations.

Imagine saying =="if X happened, then something might/could/would happen."== That's basically how second conditionals work: 
- A [[Past tense]] if clause
- A `subject + would/could/might + infinitive` to show what might happen.

```py
If I had wings, I would fly to the moon.
   ^condition   ^result

If you spoke English, you could get a better job.
   ^condition         ^result

If it weren't for his help, I might be dead now.
   ^condition               ^result

I'd never tell anyone if you told me your secret.
^result                  ^condition

Would you help me if I asked you nicely?
^result              ^condition
```

>[!important] 
> In the second conditional, **"if I were"** (formal) replaces **"if I was"** (informal). 
> However, advice using **"if I were you"** ==always requires "were," not "was."==
