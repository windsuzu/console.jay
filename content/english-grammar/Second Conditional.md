The second conditional deals with hypothetical situations that are unlikely or impossible in the present or future. It describes **what would happen if something different were true.** It's like imagining alternative realities!

> [!important] First vs Second Conditional
> We use the **[[first conditional]]** to talk about **possible** future situations and we use the **second conditional** to talk about **hypothetical** or **imaginary** future situations.
## Structure
- Condition ([[past tense]])
- Result (I + would/could/might + infinitive)
- If + condition + , + result
- Result + if + condition
## Examples
- If I **had** wings, I **would fly** to the moon.
- If you **spoke** English, you **could get** a better job.
- If it **weren't** for his help, I **might be dead** now.
- **I‘d** never **tell** anyone if you **told** me your secret.
- **Would** you **help** me if I **asked** you nicely?
## Caveats
In the second conditional we can use **if I/he/she/it were** (more formal) instead of **if I/he/she/it was** (spoken English). But we use **were** (NOT **was**) when we give advice with the expression **if I were you**.
- If I **were/was** fit, I would run a marathon.
- I wouldn’t pay any attention to what he says if **I were** you.
