When there is a main event and events before it, we use the **past perfect** to describe the earlier events and the [[Past Simple]] to describe the main event.
## Earlier events
- When she opened the door, he **had already left**.  
- I realised that I **had been there before**. 
- When I met her, I **had never been** in a serious relationship.
- He noticed I **had cleaned** the car. 

## How much or how many had been done
- We **had driven** 500 miles and we needed some rest. 
- How many hours **had he slept** when you woke him up?

## Stative verbs
We use **past perfect** with [[Stative or non-action verbs]] to describe events that had started earlier in the past with a "duration" (e.g., how long, for, since, always, etc)
- The day Anne died, they **had been** married **for 48 years**. 
- The day I left, I **had been** in England **for exactly 4 years**.
- She told me she **had always hated** her sister.
