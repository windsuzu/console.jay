To express a clear preference, we can use 'would rather' or 'would sooner' followed by an infinitive. These phrases can also be combined with 'than' to compare options or 'or' to list alternatives.

- **I'd rather/sooner have** tea, please. 
- **I'd rather/sooner have** tea **than** coffee.
- **Would you rather/sooner have** tea **or** coffee?

### Different Subject + Past Simple
When using "would rather/sooner" followed by another person/thing, the verb tense should shift to [[past simple]] to express a **present or future** preference about their action.

- We'd rather/sooner **she was/were** with us now.
- She'd rather/sooner **I picked her up** after lunch. 
- Would you rather/sooner **we went** by bus or by train?

### Different Subject + Past Perfect
When using "would rather/sooner" followed by another person/thing, the verb tense should shift to [[past perfect]] to express a **past** preference about their action.

- I'd rather/sooner **you hadnâ€™t spoken** to her like that.
- I'd rather/sooner **you had called** me before.
