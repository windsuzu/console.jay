**How do we refer to people in certain groups?** A common approach is to use `the + adjective (without noun)`. For example, we can say **"the deaf"** to refer to people who are deaf.

>[!example] More examples
>- The government is going to provide more help for **the mentally ill**. 
> - New taxation system doesnâ€™t help **the poor**. 
> - **The rich** vote republican in the US. 
> - They have organized a marathon to give support to **the blind**. 
> - **The jobless** are losing hope of finding a good job. 
> - This tradition has existed for centuries to keep the memory of **the dead**. 
> - Their organization raises money to help **the handicapped**. 

In some contexts, you can simply use a `noun` to refer to a general group of people, without needing the definite article `the` before the `adjective`. For instance, **"I love flowers"** sounds more natural than **"I love ~~the~~ flowers."**
