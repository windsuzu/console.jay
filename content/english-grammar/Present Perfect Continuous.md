## Actions from the past till now
We use **present perfect continuous** to talk about situations that started in the past and **have not finished** or **have just finished**. And the action often produces some **present results**.
- **Have you been crying**? Your eyes are red.
- I am dirty because **I‘ve been painting**. 

We can also use **present perfect continuous** to talk about **repeated** or **continuous** actions from the past till now.
- **She's been calling** you for days. (repeated)
- **I‘ve been studying** since you left. (continuous)

## To express duration
We can use **present perfect continuous** with some **duration words (for, since, how long, lately, all day, etc)** to talk about how long a situation has been happening.
- **He’s been annoying** us all evening.
- **She’s been studying** very hard for weeks.
- **I haven’t been feeling** well lately.
- How long **have you been playing** golf?
