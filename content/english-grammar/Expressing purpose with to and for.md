## Don't use `for` to explain why

We **don’t use** `for -ing` to explain the reason or cause behind something.

>[!example]
>- I work hard ~~for improving~~ my English. ❌
>- I work hard **to improve** my English. ✅
>- Turn the TV on ~~for watching~~ the news. ❌
>- Turn the TV on **to watch** the news. ✅
## Use `for` to show purpose or function

Both `to + infinitive` and `for -ing` describe an object's function (the purpose or intended use of an object).

>[!example]
> - This machine is used **for cleaning** cars.
> - This machine is used **to clean** cars.
> - This is a special camera **for photographing** small objects.  
> - This is a special camera **to photograph** small objects.
