We can use `some` or `any` with both `countable plural nouns` or `uncountable singular nouns`.

**Countable Plural Nouns**:
- Apples, Chairs, Books, Dogs, Cars

**Uncountable Singular Nouns**:
- Water, Sugar, Air, Information, Furniture

>[!example]
>- He gave me **some** **coins**.
>- He didn’t give me **any coins**.
>- He gave me **some money**.
>- Have you got **any brothers or sisters**?

>[!tip] Some
>We use **some** in questions when we are **asking for something**, or we are **offering something**.
>- **Can** I have **any** tea? (unusual)
>- **Can** I have **some** tea? ✅
>- **Can** you give me **any** advice (unusual)
>- **Can** you give me **some** advice ✅

If we use `some` or `any` before a countable noun, the noun must be in the **plural form**.

>[!example]
>- ~~Is~~ there any ~~student~~ in the classroom? ❌
> - **Are** there **any students** in the classroom? ✅
