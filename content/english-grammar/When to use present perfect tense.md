The **present perfect tense** is occasionally mistaken for the [[past simple tense]], but I've discovered a method to tell them apart. If you want to talk about an event that occurred at a specific moment or during a particular period in the past (and it didn't continue up to the present), you should employ the [[past simple tense]]. However, when you come across the situations listed below, it's appropriate to use the **present perfect tense**.

## 1. When talking about a past event without a specific time
- **I have (I've)** **broken** my arm.
- **She has (She's)** **found** the job. 

## 2. When the sentence has: `just`, `already`, `yet`
- Tony **has just** **called**.
- **I‘ve already finished** my homework. 
- **Have** you **finished** your homework **yet**?

## 3. When the event occurred recently
- **They‘ve recently bought** a new car.  

## 4. When the time we mentioned has not yet finished
- **I‘ve seen** John **today**. 
- **Has** she **called** you **this week**?
- **She’s been** with me all day. 
- **I’ve been** very busy lately. 

## 5. When talking about the past experience with `ever`, `never` or `before`
- **I‘ve never read** this book.
- **Have** you **ever** **seen** a John Wayne film.
- I **haven’t experienced** anything like this **before**.
- This is the **best** mea**l I’ve ever had**.

## 6. When you want to say how many times something has happened until now
- **I’ve watched** this film **three times**. 
- **We’ve been** to Paris **twice**. 

## 7. Have gone to or have been to
We use 'has gone to' when someone is still there, and we use 'has been to' when someone has come back.
- Tom **has gone to** Ireland. He’ll be there for a couple of weeks.
- We **have been to** Ireland three times. We love it.

## 8. Ask or talk about situations that started in the past and have not finished
Sentences in this category are usually accompanied by the words `for`, `since` and `how long`. We use `for` followed by a period of time, such as `two days` or `three weeks`. We use `since` followed by the moment in the past when something started.
- **We've been married** for 25 years.
- **I've had** this watch since I was a kid.
- How long **have you been** friends?
