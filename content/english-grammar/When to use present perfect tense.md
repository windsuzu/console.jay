The **present perfect tense** is occasionally mistaken for the [[past simple tense]], but I've discovered a method to tell them apart. If you want to talk about an event that occurred at a specific moment or during a particular period in the past (and it didn't continue up to the present), you should employ the [[past simple tense]]. However, when you come across the situations listed below, it's appropriate to use the **present perfect tense**.

## 1. When talking about a past event without a specific time
- **I have (I've)** **broken** my arm.
- **She has (She's)** **found** the job. 

## 2. When the sentence has: `just`, `already`, `yet`
- Tony **has just** **called**.
- **I‘ve already finished** my homework. 
- **Have** you **finished** your homework **yet**?

## 3. When the event occurred recently
- **They‘ve recently bought** a new car.  

## 4. When the time we mentioned has not yet finished
- **I‘ve seen** John **today**. 
- **Has** she **called** you **this week**?

## 5. When talking about the past experience with `ever`, `never` or `before`
- **I‘ve never read** this book.
- **Have** you **ever** **seen** a John Wayne film.
- I **haven’t experienced** anything like this **before**.
- This is the **best** mea**l I’ve ever had**.

## 6. When you want to say how many times something has happened until now
- **I’ve watched** this film **three times**. 
- **We’ve been** to Paris **twice**. 

## 7. Have gone to or have been to
We say someone has gone to when someone is still there, And we say someone has been to when someone has come back.
