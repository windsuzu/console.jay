## Mixed third/second conditional
We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the past ([[third conditional]]) with a present result ([[second conditional]]). 
- If I **had been** elected, I **would** be the president now.
- If I **had won** the lottery, I **would** be rich.
- I **might have** a better job now if I **hadn’t dropped** out of school.

## Mixed second/third conditional
We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the present (second conditional) with a past result (third conditional).
- If I **were** a man, they **would have given** me the job.
- If I **didn’t have** so much work, I **would have gone** to the party last night.
- I **would have understood** them if I **spoke** German.

> [!important] 
> **In mixed second/third conditionals, the hypothetical present situation is assumed to have also been true in the past, impacting a past outcome.** For example, in the sentence: "I **would have understood** them if I **spoke** German.", the speaker implies that they **didn't speak German** in the past when they **wanted to understand** the other people.
