## Mixed third/second conditional
We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the past (third conditional) with a present result (second conditional). 
- If I **had been** elected, I **would** be the president now.
- If I **had won** the lottery, I **would** be rich.
- I **might have** a better job now if I **hadn’t dropped** out of school.

## Mixed second/third conditional
We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the present (second conditional) with a past result (third conditional).
- If I **were** a man, they **would have given** me the job.
- If I **didn’t have** so much work, I **would have gone** to the party last night.
- I **would have understood** them if I **spoke** German.

> [!important] 
> In Mixed second/third conditional, the present condition also existed in the past, when the result in the main clause took place.
