## Mixed third/second conditional
We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the past ([[third conditional]]) with a present result ([[second conditional]]).

```py
If I had been elected, I would be the president now.
   ^condition (3rd)    ^result (2nd)

If I had won the lottery, I would be rich.
   ^condition (3rd)       ^result (2nd)

I might have a better job now if I hadn't dropped out of school.
^result (2nd)                    ^condition (3rd)
```



## Mixed second/third conditional
We use this combination to talk about a hypothetical condition happening in the present (second conditional) with a past result (third conditional).

```py
If I were a man,     they would have given me the job.
   ^condition (2nd)  ^result (3rd)

If I didn't have so much work, I would have gone to the party last night.
   ^condition (2nd)            ^result (3rd)

I would have understood them if I spoke German.
^result (3rd)                   ^condition (2nd)
```

> **In mixed second/third conditionals, the hypothetical present situation is assumed to have also been true in the past, impacting a past outcome.**

> For example, in the sentence: "I **would have understood** them if I **spoke** German.", the speaker implies that they **didn't speak German** in the past when they **wanted to understand** the other people.
