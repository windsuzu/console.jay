Depending on the meaning and the subject, the expression “It’s time” can be followed by either a **to-infinitive** or a **[[past simple]] verb**.
## to-infinitive
When we use a to-infinitive, **we are talking about the right time to do something**, either for ourselves or for someone else.
- **It’s time to go** to bed. (This is the right time for me to go to bed.)
- **It’s time for you to do** your homework. (This is the right time for you to do your homework.)
## It's time + past simple
When we use a past simple verb, **we are talking about something that should be done now or in the future**, ==**but it is already a bit late or urgent**==. 

We often use **It’s high time** or **It’s about time** to emphasize. For example:
- **It’s time we left**. (We should leave now, or we should have left earlier.)
- **It’s high time you cleaned** your room. (You should clean your room now, or you should have cleaned it earlier.)

> [!note] 
> The reason why we use a past simple verb in this case is because we are expressing an unreal or hypothetical situation, similar to the [[second conditional]]. We are imagining that the action has already been done, but in reality it hasn’t.
