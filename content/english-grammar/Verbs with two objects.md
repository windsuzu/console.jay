**Verbs with two objects** are verbs that can take both a [[Direct and Indirect Object|direct object and an indirect object]] in the same sentence. 

In a sentence, **the direct object** bears the brunt of the verb's action, while **the indirect object** reaps the benefit or receives the direct object. For example:

```
She gave him a book

a book = direct object
   him = indirect object
```

There are **two types of structures** when using verbs with two objects:
- She gave him a book. (verb + indirect object + direct object)
- She gave a book to him. (verb + direct object + preposition + indirect object)

## To or For

The choice between "to" and "for" depends on the meaning you want to convey and the verb used. Typically, "to" indicates the recipient of an action, while "for" signifies the beneficiary.

```py
He sent a letter to his friend.
= his friend is the one who received the letter.

He bought a gift for his friend.
= his friend is the one who benefited from the gift
```
