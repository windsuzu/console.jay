Future time clauses, introduced by words like **when, as soon as, before, after, and until,** describe **upcoming events and their relationship to another event** in the main clause. While similar to [[first conditional]] in structure, they differ in their **function and time frame.**

## Structure
- Future time clause ([[present tense]])
- main clause ([[future tense]], [[Modals, the imperative, phrasal verbs|modal, imperative]])
- Future time clause + , + main clause
- Main clause + future time clause
## Examples
- **When** **I'm** 69, I **will** retire. (future)
- **As soon as** you **arrive**, **call** me. (imperative)
- **Until** you all **finish**, nobody **can** leave. (modal)
- You **should** text me **before** you **come**.

## Caveats
When we use a verb after **when, as soon as, before, after**or **until** to talk about the future, we have to use this verb in [[present tense]] (NOT future).
- You **might** need some help **once** you **are** there **tomorrow**.
