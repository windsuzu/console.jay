Like [[reporting verbs]], 'seem' and 'appear' distance us from the information.

## It + seems/appear + that + clause

This is the most common construction, simply stating the perceived situation.

>[!example] 
>- **It seems that** the new series will begin shooting in about two months.
>- **It appears that** the situation is finally under control.

>[!note] A more formal way
> `It would seem/appear that` adds a layer of formality, often used in written communication.
>- **It would seem that** the new series will begin shooting in about two months.
>- **It would appear that** the situation is finally under control.

## Subject + seem/appear + to + infinitive

This structure explores perceived actions or states, using the infinitive tense (simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous) to show the timeframe.

>[!example]
>- The new secretary **seems** **to be** very concerned about climate. 
>	- (simple infinitive)
>- They **seem** **to be having** some difficulties.
>	- (continuous infinitive)
>- Their leaders **appear** **to have suffered** some setbacks.
>	- (perfect infinitive)
>- The company **appears to have been doing** very well over the last year.
>	- (perfect continuous infinitive)

## There + seem(s) + to be (to have been)

This impersonal construction focuses on the perceived existence or occurrence of something. 

>[!example]
>- **There seem to be** two options for kids.
>- **There seems to have been** a great response in social media.
