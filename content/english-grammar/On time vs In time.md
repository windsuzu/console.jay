**What's the difference between `on time` and `in time`?** `On time` is used to indicate punctuality, signifying that a plan, schedule, or person has arrived or occurred as expected. Conversely, `in time` signifies that someone or something has not arrived late, ensuring they arrive before an event.

### On time
For instance, if a train is supposed to depart at 8 am and it leaves at 8 am, it is considered `on time.` This term is commonly used for scheduled events such as meetings, appointments, or transportation arrivals.

>[!example]
>- I hope the flight is **on time.**
>- The meeting started **on time.**

### In time
For example, if you reach a restaurant ``in time`` for dinner, it means you arrived early enough to dine comfortably. This phrase is often used with `for` + noun or `to` + infinitive.

>[!example]
>- I hope the card arrives **in time for** his birthday.
>- We arrived at the theatre **in time to** get good seats.
