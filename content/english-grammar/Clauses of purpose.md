### To
We can use `to + infinitive` to express purpose.

>[!example]
>- The student worked hard **to** pass the test. ✅
>- The student worked hard ~~for passing~~ the test. ❌
### In order (not) to/so as (not) to
`In order to` and `so as to` are more formal ways to express purpose in writing compared to `to`. All three are followed by an `infinitive`.

>[!example]
>- We were asked to stay **in order to** finish the project. 
>- He left home early **in order not to** be late.
>- Use a plastic hammer **so as to** avoid damage. 
>- They walked quietly **so as not to** wake up the children. 

### For
We can also use `for + noun` to express purpose.

>[!example]
>- We went to the bar **for** a drink.
>- Would you like to go to the park **for** a run?

### So that
We can use `so that + clause` to express purpose. Modal verbs like `could,` `can,` or `would` often accompany this structure.

>[!example]
>- We left early **so that** we **could** park near the center.
>- He made some flashcards **so that** it **would** be easier for his mum to remember the instructions. 

### In case
To express precautions, we use `in case + clause`.

>[!example]
>- Take the umbrella **in case** it rains. 
>- I won’t tell Ann **in case** she tells everyone else.
