We use `another + a singular noun` and `other + a plural noun` when both of them are used as determiners.

>[!example]
>- I need **another cup** of coffee. (singular)
>- I want to talk to **other doctors**. (plural)

When discussing the second of two things, or the opposite of two things, we use `the other + a singular noun` (observe that there is `the` before `other`), 

>[!example]
>- This computer here is new. 
>- ~~Another~~ computer is about five years old. ❌
>- **The other** computer is about five years old. ✅

Additionally, to refer to the remaining items in a group, we use `the other + a plural noun`.

>[!example]
>- Joel and Karen are here, but where are **the other kids**?
