**How can I correctly refer to people based on their country?** There are two main groups of countries, each with common suffixes used to form their demonyms (words for people from a place).

## -ch, -sh, -ese, -ss

### Plural
We can use the definite article `the` with a `nationality adjective` (e.g., French, Portuguese) to refer to all people from countries ending in `-ch,` `-sh,` `-ese,` or `-ss`.

>[!example]
>- **The English** like their privacy. 
>- **The Swiss** are voting on emigration again.
>- **The Chinese** are unhappy about the new system.

### Singular
While `-man` or `-woman` typically follows nationality adjectives ending in `-ch,` `-sh,` `-ese,` or `-ss,` some exceptions exist. These include using `Spaniard,` `Dane,` `Finn,` `Scot,` `Pole,` `Swede,` and `Turk` for a single person from their respective countries.

>[!example]
>- **The Englishman** sipped his tea while gazing out at the misty countryside.
>- **The Swede** and **the Turk** sat together in the bustling café, sharing stories of their distant homelands.

## Others

For most nationalities, the noun itself refers to a single person. To indicate all people from that country, simply add an "-s" to the noun.

>[!example] Plural examples
> - **The Belgians** are known for their excellent chocolate. 
> - **The Brazilians** were shocked after their national team’s defeat. 
> - The demonstrators were shouting: ‘Greece belongs to **the Greeks.**’

>[!example] Singular examples
>- Sarah was delighted to meet **a Moroccan** who shared her passion for traditional North African cuisine.
