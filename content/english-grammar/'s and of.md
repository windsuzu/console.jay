When writing, we use an apostrophe and an "s" (like this: `'s`) to show that something belongs to or is closely associated with a person or pet.

>[!example] 
> - This is **Peter's** father. ✅
> - This is the father of Peter. ❌
> - My **cat‘s** ears are white. ✅
> - The ears of my cat are white. ❌

However, for inanimate objects (not people or pets), use `of` instead of `'s`.

>[!example]
>- The **end of the street** ✅
>- The street‘s end ❌
>- A picture of the eclipse ✅
>- The eclipse‘s picture ❌
