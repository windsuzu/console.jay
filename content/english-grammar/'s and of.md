When writing, we use an apostrophe and an "s" (like this: `'s`) to show that something belongs to or is closely associated with a person.

>[!example] 
> - This is **Peter's** father. ✅
> - This is the father of Peter. ❌
> - My **cat‘s** ears are white. ✅
> - The ears of my cat are white. ❌

However, for inanimate objects (not people or pets), use `of` instead of `'s`.

>[!example]
>- The **end of the street** ✅
>- The street‘s end ❌
>- A **picture of the eclipse** ✅
>- The eclipse‘s picture ❌ 

## Exceptions

We can use `'s` with time expressions.

>[!example]
>- **yesterday's** party, **today's** news, **last year's** conference
>- **two hours'** walk, **three days'** drive, **one month's** salary,

When we talk about places or organizations, we can use both `of` and `'s`.

>[!example]
>- The decision of **the country**
>- **The country's** decision
>- The prediction of **the bank**
>- **The bank's** prediction
>- He's one of **Britain's best chefs**.

If there is a determiner (**a, some, this, etc.**) before the nouns, then we should use `of` instead of `'s`.

>[!example]
>- **Some friends** of Anna's came to the party. ✅
>- Anna's some friends came to the party. ❌
>- **Some friends** of hers came to the party. ✅
>- Isn't that **a friend** of your sister's? ✅

In cases where the person is described with a lengthy phrase, we typically use `of` instead of the `'s` to maintain sentence clarity and flow.

>[!example]
>- This is the child **of the neighbors who live next door**. ✅
>- This is ~~the neighbors who live next door's~~ child. ❌
>- That's the wife **of one of my friends from Liverpool**. ✅
>- That's ~~one of my friends from Liverpool's~~ wife. ❌
