Distinguishing between the time to use the present simple tense and the [[Present Continuous|present continuous tense]] can be difficult. We can use the present simple tense in the following situations:

## 1. Habits or actions that occur regularly and repeatedly
- I **wash** my hair every day.
- I never **go** to the library.
- Every hour we **destroy** 6000 acres of rainforests (thatâ€™s 4000 football fields).

## 2. Permanent situations or things that are generally true
- I **have** two brothers.
- Water **boils** at 100 degrees.

## 3. When combined with adverbs or expressions of frequency
- We **usually** **order** a pizza on Fridays.
- I **go** running **twice a week**.

## 4. [[Stative or Non-action Verbs]]
Some of these verbs are: **be**, **have** (=possess/own), **like**, **love**, **hate**, **prefer**, **need**, **want**, **know**, **seem**, etc.
- They **have** a new car.
- I **like** chocolate.
- I **love** my job.

## 5. Future Events that are timetabled
- The train **leaves** at 4.
