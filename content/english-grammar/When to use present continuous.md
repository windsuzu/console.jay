We use the present continuous tense in the following situations:

## 1. Actions that are happening right now
The **"right now"** here means **"at the moment of speaking"**.
- What **are** you **doing**?
- I **am watching** TV.

## 2. Actions that are happening around now
The **"around now"** here means **"not at the moment of speaking"** but **"in recent days or weeks"**. 
- I **am reading** a very good book at the moment.
- What TV series **are** you **watching** these days?

## 3. Actions that are changing, developing, or in progress now
- The way of life in the rainforests **is also changing** because of climate change.
- Fortunately, it seems that now some governments **are beginning** to understand the problem.
