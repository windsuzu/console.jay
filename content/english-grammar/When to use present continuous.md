We use the present continuous tense in the following situations:

## 1. Actions that are happening right now
The **"right now"** here means **"at the moment of speaking"**.
- What **are** you **doing**?
- I **am watching** TV.
## 2. Actions that are happening around now
The **"around now"** here means **"not at the moment of speaking"** but **"in recent days or weeks"**. 
- I **am reading** a very good book at the moment.
- What TV series **are** you **watching** these days?

> [!note]
> Here are some time expressions express **now** or **around now**: `now`, `at the moment`, `at present`, `today`, `these days`, `this week`, etc.
