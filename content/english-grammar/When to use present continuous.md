We use the present continuous tense in the following situations:

## 1. Actions that are happening right now
The **"right now"** here means **"at the moment of speaking"**.
- What **are** you **doing**?
- I **am watching** TV.
## 2. Actions that are happening around now
The **"around now"** here means **"not at the moment of speaking"** but **"in recent days or weeks"**.
