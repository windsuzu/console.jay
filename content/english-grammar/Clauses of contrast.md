### Although, Even though
At the beginning or in the middle of a sentence, we can use `although` or `even though` to show contrast, both of which must be followed by a **dependent clause.**

>[!example]
>- **Although** we had a bad game, we won. 
>- We won, **even though** we had a bad game.

### Despite, In spite of
`Despite` and `In spite of` function mostly like `although`. However, Both can only be followed by a noun or a [[gerund]].

>[!example]
>- **Despite** the rain, we went to the concert.
>- They arrived **in spite of** leaving very early. 

### However
`However` is a tool to connect two separate sentences. `However` should be followed by a comma.

>[!example]
>- We didn’t like the hotel. **However**, we had a fantastic time. 
>- We went to the beach; **however**, the weather wasn’t perfect.
