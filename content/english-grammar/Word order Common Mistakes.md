>[!question]- He \____ (usually, doesn't) go to bed late. 
>✅ doesn't usually ❌ usually doesn't

> - We can focus on an element of the sentence by using these structures such as **the reason why, the thing that, the person/people who, the place where, the day when…**  with a relative clause.
> - We need **that** and not **where** because we are focusing on an object, not on an adverbial of place. Compare:
> 	- I love the beach ⇒ The place that I love is the beach. (the beach= direct object)
> 	- I met her at the beach ⇒ The place where I met her was the beach. (the beach= adverbial of place)

>[!question]- \___ (focus on when) I read the email that I realized she was leaving me.

> - Instead of **the person who, the thing that, etc.** we can also use an introductory **it,** the verb **be** in any verb tense that we may need, and the element that we want to focus on.
> - _**The moment when** I realised she was leaving me was when I read the email ⇒ **It was when I read the email that** I realised she was leaving me._

>[!question]- What we did is \____ (write) a letter to apologize.
>✅ (to) write ❌ writing ❌ wrote 
> - We can use **what + subject + do/does/did/ + is/was + (to) infinitive** when we want to focus on the verb or verb phrase.

>[!question]- The reason why he left \____ (avoid) the embarrassment.
>✅ was to avoid ❌ was avoid ❌ was avoiding 
> - To focus on the reason why we do something we can use the reason why ... is/was + to infinitive.
