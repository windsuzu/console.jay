The zero conditional describes things that are always true, like scientific facts or general truths about the world. **It expresses what always happens when one thing happens.**

## Structure
- Condition ([[present tense]])
- Result ([[present tense]])
- If + condition + , + result
- Result + if + condition
- You can also replace **"if"** with **"when"** without changing the meaning.

## Examples
- If you heat ice, it melts.
- People get thirsty if they don't drink enough water.
- When the sun goes down, it gets dark.
