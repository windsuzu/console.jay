## Get something done

Similar to [[Have something done, Have someone do|have something done]], we use the construction `get + something + past participle` to indicate that someone else performs an action for us.

```py
# By ourselves
We clean the house every Friday.

# By someone else
We get the house cleaned every Friday.
```

>[!example] 
>- I need to **get my eyes tested**.
>- They **got their home rebuilt** after the earthquake.  

## Get someone to do

The construction `get + person + to + infinitive` allows us to ==specify who performs an action for us==, often because we have convined them to do so.

>[!example]
>- I **got a mechanic to take** a look at the car.
>- Tomâ€™s boss **got him to go** to a conference in Germany.

>[!tip]
> Get someone to do and [[Have something done, Have someone do|have someone do]] differ primarily in their nuance. The former implies persuasion or convincing someone to take action, while the latter simply states assigning a task.
