**What are clauses of result?** These clauses explain the outcome of an action or situation. In everyday speech, you can use words like `so` or `for this reason.` For a more formal tone, opt for phrases like `as a result,` `consequently,` or `therefore.`

### So
`so + clause` (less formal)

>[!example]
>- We didn’t have anything to do, **so** we decided to rent a film. 
>- I worked very hard today, **so** I’m exhausted. 

### For this reason
`For this reason + , + clause` (less formal)

>[!example]
>- Rent is very expensive in Boston. **For this reason,** we decided to move to Ohio. 
>- He threatened to commit suicide. **For this reason,** we kept him under surveillance. 

### As a result
`As a result + , + clause` (more formal)

>[!example]
>- The flight was delayed due to the storm. **As a result,** many passengers complained.  

### Consequently, Therefore
- `consequently / therefore + , + clause` (more formal)

>[!example]
>- Animals were his only true passion. **Therefore/Consequently,** he decided to study biology. 

- `be / first auxiliary verb + consequently / therefore + verb` (in mid position)

>[!example]
>- You have been a real asset to the company. We have **therefore/consequently** decided to promote you.
