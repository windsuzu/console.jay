The placement of prepositions in relative clauses depends on its formality. Prepositions often go to the end of the relative clauses when it's **informal**, and show up before the relative pronouns when it's **formal**.

>[!example]
>- The book **(that)** I borrowed **from** the library is due tomorrow. (Informal)
>- The company **with which** we partnered is expanding to new markets. (formal)

Here are some commonly used prepositions with relative pronouns and examples in both formal and informal styles:

- **At:** The cafe **at which** we met (formal) / The cafe **we met at** (informal)
- **By:** The method **by which** they solved the problem (formal) / The method **they solved the problem by** (informal)
- **For:** The reason **for which** she was late (formal) / The reason **she was late for** (informal)
- **In:** The town **in which** I grew up (formal) / The town **I grew up in** (informal)
- **Of:** The friend **of whom** I spoke (formal) / The friend **I spoke of** (informal)
- **On:** The day **on which** it happened (formal) / The day **it happened on** (informal)
- **To:** The person **to whom** I gave the gift (formal) / The person **I gave the gift to** (informal)
- **With:** The colleague **with whom** I work (formal) / The colleague **I work with** (informal)
