**Reporting verbs** are words that express someone's saying or belief. We use them **to convey information** while **separating ourselves** from the original source. There are a lot of reporting verbs. Here are some examples, **grouped by the kind of message they convey**:

- **Saying:** said, stated, mentioned, commented, declared, announced
- **Believing:** thought, believed, considered, felt, suspected, assumed
- **Denying:** denied, disagreed, refused, disputed, contradicted, challenged
- **Questioning:** asked, inquired, wondered, questioned, queried, doubted

Reporting verbs can be used in the **passive voice** to distance ourselves from the source of the information. Here are two common ways to do this:

- **It is said that they are** in Las Vegas. (**With impersonal "it"**, more formal)
- **Thay are said to be** in Las Vegas. (**With the subject**, more informal)

### With Impersonal "it"
When using reporting verbs with the impersonal "it", **the clause** following "that" can be in any tense to reflect the reported time frame.

- **It is believed that** the murderer is no longer in the country.
- **It has been announced that** they are going to cancel the tour.
- **It has been suggested that** the team can’t be trusted defensively.

### With the subject
Using reporting verbs with the subject allows for three distinct ways to express information across different tenses:
#### 1. to + infinitive
This structure is used when the reported action aligns with the time of reporting.

- He **is said to have** the biggest private art collection in the country (implying it's true now).
- They **were believed to be** secretly in love (past belief about their current state).

Additionally, this structure can be used to make predictions about the future.

- She **is expected to become** a superstar (prediction based on current indications).
#### 2. to + be -ing
This structure is used when the reported action is in progress **simultaneously** to the reporting.

- They **are thought to be living** under strict protection. 
#### 3. to + have participle
This structure is used when the reported action is **previous** to the reporting (earlier in the past)

- She **was thought to have left** the previous week. 
	- (she left before people thought about it)
- He i**s claimed to have hit** another student.
	- (he hit another student first and people claimed he did it later)
