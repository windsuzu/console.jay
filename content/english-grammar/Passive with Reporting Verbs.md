**Reporting verbs** are words that express someone's saying or belief. We use them **to convey information** while **separating ourselves** from the original source. There are a lot of reporting verbs. Here are some examples, **grouped by the kind of message they convey**:

- **Saying:** said, stated, mentioned, commented, declared, announced
- **Believing:** thought, believed, considered, felt, suspected, assumed
- **Denying:** denied, disagreed, refused, disputed, contradicted, challenged
- **Questioning:** asked, inquired, wondered, questioned, queried, doubted

Reporting verbs can be used in the **passive voice** to distance ourselves from the source of the information. Here are two common ways to do this:

- **It is said that they are** in Las Vegas. (**With impersonal "it"**, more formal)
- **Thay are said to be** in Las Vegas. (**With the subject**, more informal)

### With Impersonal "it"


- **It is believed that** the murderer is no longer in the country.
- **It has been announced that** they are going to cancel the tour.
- **It has been suggested that** the team can’t be trusted defensively.
- **It was thought** the building could collapse.

### With the subject
