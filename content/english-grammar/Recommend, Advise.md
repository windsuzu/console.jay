The verbs `recommend`, `advise` offer various usage options. When you don't specify a recipient, use them with `verb-ing`.

>[!example]
>- He **recommended taking** the course.
>- He **advised going**.

For specific recommendations, use either the following constructions: 
- `recommend/advise + (that) + object + clause`
- `recommend/advise + object + to + infinitive`

>[!example]
>- I **recommended** (that) he stays.
>- I **recommended** him **to** stay.
>- He **advised** me (that) I should go.
>- He **advised** me **to** go
