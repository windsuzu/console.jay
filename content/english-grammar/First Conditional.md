The first conditional describes possible future situations and what you would do if those situations happened. **It expresses a kind of prediction based on a hypothetical possibility.**
## Structure
- Condition ([[present tense]])
- Result ([[future tense]], [[Modals, the imperative, phrasal verbs|modal, imperative]])
- If + condition + comma + result 
- Result + if + condition
- We can also use **unless** in conditional sentences to mean **if** … (**not**)
## Examples
- If you **study**, you **will pass the exam**. (future tense)
- If you **want** to lose weight, you **must/should** eat less sugary things. (modal verb)
- If you **arrive** after midnight, **ring** me on my mobile. (imperative)
- I **will** help you if you **need** me.
- I **won’t** go on holiday **unless** I (=if I don't) save some money.
## Caveats
The condition **(if clause)** may have a present or a future meaning, but the **verb** is **always** **in present** (NOT future).
- **If** you **are** a good boy tomorrow, mummy will buy you a present.
