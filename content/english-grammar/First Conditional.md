The first conditional explores potential future scenarios and your responses to them.

Using first conditionals is like making deals. The "if" part is like setting the terms, using the [[present tense]] to say what might happen. 

The other part is the payoff, using [[future tense]] or [[Modals, the imperative, phrasal verbs]] like "should," "can," or even an imperative "do this" to say what happens if you meet those terms.

```py
If you study hard, you will pass the exam.
   ^condition      ^result (future)
   
If you want to lose weight, you should eat less sugary things.
   ^condition               ^result (modal)

If you arrive after midnight, ring me on my mobile.
   ^condition                 ^result (imperative)

I will help you if you need me.
^result (future)   ^condition

I won't go on holiday unless I save some money.
^result (future)             ^condition
```
