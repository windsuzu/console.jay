**Reporting verbs** convey speakers' thoughts/beliefs, ==distancing us from the source==. Here are some, grouped by message type.

- **Saying:** said, stated, mentioned, commented, declared, announced
- **Believing:** thought, believed, considered, felt, suspected, assumed
- **Denying:** denied, disagreed, refused, disputed, contradicted, challenged
- **Questioning:** asked, inquired, wondered, questioned, queried, doubted

**Reporting verbs** can be used in the **passive voice** to distance ourselves from the source of the information. Here are two common ways to do this:

**With impersonal "it"**, it becomes formal. **The clause** following "that" can be in any tense to reflect the reported time frame.

>[!example] 
> - **It is said that they are** in Las Vegas.
>- **It is believed that** the murderer is no longer in the country.
>- **It has been announced that** they are going to cancel the tour.
>- **It has been suggested that** the team can’t be trusted defensively.

**With the subject**, it becomes less formal. Using reporting verbs with the subject allows for three distinct ways to express information across different tenses:

>[!example] 
>- They are said to **be** in Las Vegas. (to + infinitive)
>- They are said to **be playing** in Las Vegas. (to + be -ing)
>- They are said to **have been** in Las Vegas. (to + have participle)
