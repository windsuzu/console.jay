**What are prepositions of time?** They help us express **when** something happens. Three common ones are `at`, `in`, and `on`.

### At
`At` is used to indicate specific points in time, including times of day, mealtimes, and bedtime. (`at 3 o’clock`, `at 10.30 am`, `at noon`, `at dinnertime`, `at bedtime`, `at sunrise`, `at sunset`)

>[!example]
>- I have a meeting **at** **9 a.m.**
>- The shop closes **at midnight.**
>- Jane went home **at lunchtime.**

`At` is also used with some specific phrases, such as `at the weekend`, `at Christmas/Easter`, `at the same time`, `at present`, `at the moment`.

>[!example]
>- I don’t usually work **at the weekend.**
>- I stay with my family **at Christmas.**
>- We finished the test **at the same time.**
>- He’s not home **at present**. Try later.

### In
We use `in` for parts of the day (`in the morning`), longer durations (`in April`, `in summer`), specific years (`in 1990`), entire decades (`in the 1990s`), or even centuries (`in the 20th century`). It also applies to broader time concepts like the past, future, and recent years.

>[!example]
>- **In summer,** it’s too hot to do anything.
>- I’m always really busy **in December.**

### On
We use `on` with **days and dates**. 

>[!example]
>- I have a long lunch **on** **Friday**.
>- I have a meeting **on Tuesday morning**
>- It’s his birthday **on October 19th**.
>- Families gather around the tree **on Christmas Day**.
>- We celebrate with fireworks **on Independence Day.**
>- **On my birthday**, I like to treat myself to a special dessert.
>- **On New Year’s Eve**, people count down to midnight
