Reported speech, or indirect speech, tells what someone said or thought. **It requires adjusting tense, time/place expressions, and pronouns.** For example:

```py
John: Are you going to the beach today?

Me: John asked me if (whether) I was going to the beach that day.
                  ^question      ^tense                 ^time
```

When you report speech from someone said before, you have to change verb tenses, expressions, word order, pronoun, since the time and place is different.

## Tense conversion


## Expression conversion
