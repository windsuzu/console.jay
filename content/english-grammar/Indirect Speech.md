Reported speech, or indirect speech, tells what someone said or thought. **It requires adjusting tense, time/place expressions, and pronouns.** For example:

```py
John: Are you going to the beach today?

Me: John asked me if or whether I was going to the beach that day.
                  ^question       ^tense                 ^time
```
