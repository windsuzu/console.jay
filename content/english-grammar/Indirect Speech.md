Reported speech, or indirect speech, tells what someone said or thought. **It requires adjusting tense, time/place expressions, and pronouns.** For example:

```py
John: Are you going to the beach today?

Me: John asked me if (whether) I was going to the beach that day.
                  ^question      ^tense                 ^time
```

When you're telling someone what someone else said earlier, it's essential to **adjust the verb tenses, expressions, word order, and pronouns** to represent the changed context and timeline compared to the original conversation.
