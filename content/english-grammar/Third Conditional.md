The third conditional focuses on situations that are **completely unrealistic or impossible in the past**. It talks about how things **would have been different if something else had happened in the past**.

## Structure
- Condition ([[Past Perfect]])
- Result (would/could/might have + past participle)
- If + condition + , + result
- Result + if + condition
- We can also use **unless** in conditional sentences to mean **if** … (**not**)
## Examples
- If you **had come** to class more often, you **would have passed** the test.
- If he **hadn’t taken** his helmet, he **could have died**.
- If the jacket **had been** a bit cheaper, I **might have bought** it.
- I **wouldn’t have been** late if I **hadn’t overslept**.
- I **wouldn’t have arrived** on time **unless I had taken** (=if I hadn't taken) a taxi.
