Ever wonder "what if" about the past? The third conditional lets you do just that! It's like rewinding time and imagining how things could have been totally different if something else had happened.

The third conditional employs `had + past participle` ([[Past Perfect]]) in the if-clause and `subject would/could/might have + past participle` in the result clause, expressing hypothetical past situations and their outcomes.

```py
If you had come to class more often, you would have passed the test.
   ^condition                        ^result

If he hadn't taken his helmet, he could have died.
   ^condition                  ^result

If the jacket had been a bit cheaper, I might have bought it.
   ^condition                         ^result

I wouldn't have been late if I had not overslept.
^result                      ^condition

I wouldn't have arrived on time unless I had taken a taxi.
^result                                ^condition
```
