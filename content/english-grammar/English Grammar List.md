I found a useful English learning website called [test-english.com](https://test-english.com/). It has free resources and tests for levels A1 to B2. They also provide [a full list of grammar topics](https://test-english.com/grammar-points/contents/) on their website.

I found that taking cloze tests is a great way to improve grammar. So, I will go through the tests on the list and take notes on the ones I'm not familiar with.

- [[Present Tense]]
- [[Past Tense]]
- [[Future Tense]]
- [[Modals, the imperative, phrasal verbs]]
- [[Conditionals]]
- [[Passive]]
- [[Reported Speech]]
- [[-ing and the infinitive]]
