**What's the difference between `since` and `from`?** Both indicate the starting point of something like an action, state, or event. 

**While** `since` is typically used with the [[present perfect]] or [[past perfect]] tense, `from` is used in other cases, often paired with `to` or `until/till` to show the duration.

>[!example] Since
>- I have known John **since I was a child.** 
>- He’s been working for us **since he finished school.** 
>- I was exhausted; I had been at work **since 6 a.m.**

>[!example] From
>- Masks will be compulsory **from tomorrow.**
>- I’m usually here **from six o’clock.** 
>- I work **from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (or until/till 6 p.m.)**
>- The city reported 400 new COVID-19 cases **from Friday to Sunday. (or until/till Sunday)**
