Following the superlative (the most), we say `in + singular words` for places or groups of people. (_in the city, in the world, in my class, in the company_, etc.)

>[!example]
>- She is the best student **in** the class. ✅
>- She is the best student ~~of~~ the class. ❌
>- He’s the tallest **in** the family.
>- Messi is the best player **in** the world. 

And we use `of` for periods of time or a number of people. (_of the year, of my life, of my brothers, of the students_, etc.)

>[!example]
>- It was the best day of my life.
