## Have

 We use the construction `have + something + past participle` to indicate that someone else performs an action for us.

- We clean the house every Friday. (By ourselves)
- We **have the house cleaned** every Friday. (By someone)
- I am going to **have my hair cut** tomorrow.
- She is **having her house redecorated**.
- He **had his wallet stolen**. 

In addition, the construction `have + person + infinitive` allows us to specify who performs an action for us.

- We are **having the architect redesign** the ground floor.
- Susanne **had her brother prune** all the trees. 

**Remember:** In this construction, `have` functions as a main verb, **not an auxiliary**. Use `do/did` for negative and question sentences.

- We **don’t** usually have the house painted.
- **Did** you have your house painted?

## Get
We use the construction `get + something + past participle` to indicate that someone else performs an action for us.

- I need to **get my eyes tested**.
- They **got their home rebuilt** after the earthquake.  

In addition, the construction `get + person + to + infinitive` allows us to specify who performs an action for us, often because we have convined them to do so.

- I **got a mechanic to take** a look at the car.
- Tom’s boss **got him to go** to a conference in Germany.
