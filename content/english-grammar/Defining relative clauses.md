Defining relative clauses ==**provide essential information**== about the person or thing we are discussing. They **don't require commas**.

>[!example]
>- This is the music **which was used at the show**. 
>- Have they found the prisoner **who escaped last week**?
  
In defining relative clauses, we can use **that** instead of **which** or **who**.

>[!example]
>- This is the music **that** was used at the show. 
>- Have they found the prisoner **that** escaped last week?

When a clause follows a `subject-verb` structure, the relative pronoun (`who/which/that`) can be omitted.

>[!example]
>Can you pass me the box (which/that) **I keep in the top drawer**?
>You are not the man (who/that) **I thought you were**.
