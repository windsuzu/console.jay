"**I wish**" allows us to express desires or regrets about situations unlike reality. This handy tool comes with **three different ways** to build your wish:
### 1. Past Simple
When using "I wish" with the [[past simple]] tense, it **expresses a desire** for something or someone to be different right now or in the future.
- I wish **things were different**, but this is the way they are.
- I wish **I had enough money** to help you.
- I wish **I could be there** for you tomorrow.

### 2. Past Perfect
With the [[past perfect]] tense, "I wish" allows us to **express regret** for something we didn't do in the past.
- I wish I **hadn’t quit** my job two years ago.
- I wish we **hadn’t wasted** all that money.

### 3. Someone would
To gently nudge someone towards changing an annoying behavior, try saying **"I wish \[person/thing\] would \[infinitive\]."**
- I wish **you would stop biting** your nails. I hate it when you do it.
- I wish **it would stop raining**. It’s been three days!

## If only
"If only" carries the same wish as "I wish," but with a **stronger punch**.
- If only I was/were a bit taller! (First type)
- If only you had followed my advice. (Second type)
- If only you would make a bit of an effort. You are wasting your life! (Third type)
