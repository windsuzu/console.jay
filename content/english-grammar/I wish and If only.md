"I wish" expresses **desires or regrets about unreal situations**. Here are three ways to build your wish:

1. I wish I **did** something ([[past simple]])
2. I wish I **had done** something ([[past perfect]])
3. I wish someone **would do** something (would + infinitive)

### 1. Past Simple
It **expresses a desire** for something or someone to be different ==right now or in the future==.
- I wish **things were different**, but this is the way they are.
- I wish **I had enough money** to help you.
- I wish **I could be there** for you tomorrow.

### 2. Past Perfect
It allows us to **express regret** for something ==we didn't do in the past==.
- I wish I **hadn’t quit** my job two years ago.
- I wish we **hadn’t wasted** all that money.

### 3. Someone would
To gently ==nudge someone== towards changing an annoying behavior.
- I wish **you would stop biting** your nails. I hate it when you do it.
- I wish **it would stop raining**. It’s been three days!

## If only
"If only" carries the same wish as "I wish," but with a **stronger punch**.
- If only **I was/were** a bit taller! (First type)
- If only **you had followed** my advice. (Second type)
- If only **you would make** a bit of an effort. You are wasting your life! (Third type)
