**What is substitution?** It replaces a repetitive word or phrase with a pronoun (`one` or `ones`), a phrase (`do so` or `if so`), or even a simple clause (`so can I` or `neither should you`).

>[!example] One, Ones
>- ‘Do you need a pen?’ ‘No, I’ve already got **one**.’
>- Are you going to wear these trousers or the **ones** that I gave you?

>[!example] Do so, Do it, Do that
>- If I can help, I’ll be happy to **do so**. (help)
>- I won’t apologize, because **doing so** (apologizing) would be admitting that I was wrong. 
>- They told me to be quiet and I **did it/that/so**. (be quiet)

>[!example] If so, If not
>- Do you want to be better at what you do? **If so**, pay attention to what I have to say.
>- Mr Chen should be there when you arrive. **If not**, just give me a call.

To avoid repeating phrases, we can combine `so` and `not` with a variety of verbs (**assume, believe, expect, guess, hope, imagine, presume, suppose, suspect, say, tell someone, think**) and expressions (**be afraid, it seems, it appears**).

>[!example] Verbs + so or not
>- **Assume**: "Are they going to win?" "I **assume** so."
>- **Believe**: "Will it be a difficult test?" "I don't **believe** so."
>- **Expect**: "Did they enjoy the party?" "I **expected** so."
>- **Guess**: "Who left the window open?" "I **guess** it wasn't me."
>- **Hope**: "Will you be able to make it?" "I **hope** so."
>- **Imagine**: "What if they cancel the flight?" "I can't **imagine** so."
>- **Presume**: "Is this the right bus?" "I **presume** so."
>- **Suppose**: "Do you think they'll understand?" "I **suppose** so.
>- **Suspect**: "Someone must have seen what happened." "I **suspect** so."
>- **Tell** **someone**: "I told him I wouldn't be long." "You **told him** so."
>- **Think**: "Do you think it will rain?" "I don't **think** so."

>[!example] Expressions + so or not
>- **Be afraid**: "Can I borrow your phone?" "**I'm afraid** not." 
>- **It seems/appears**: "There's nobody home." "**It seems** so."
