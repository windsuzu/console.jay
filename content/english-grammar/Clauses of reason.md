**What are clauses of reason?** They explain why something happens. They're introduced by conjunctions like `because,` `as,` or `since`, or by noun phrases like `because of,` `due to,` `owing to,` or `on account of`.

### Because
`because + clause` (add comma when the clause of reason is at the beginning)

>[!example]
>- We didn’t go **because** it was raining heavily. 
>- **Because** the event was cancelled, they lost their deposits. 

### As, Since
`as / since + clause` (more formal in writing)

>[!example]
>- The government urged people to stay indoors **since** more rain is forecast for the entire weekend.
>- **As** the roads were blocked, the victims had to be rescued by helicopter. 

### Because of, Due to, Owing to, On account of
- `because of + noun` (less formal)
- `due to / owing to / on account of + noun` (more formal)

>[!example]
>- The concert was postponed **because of** the heavy rain. 
>- The event was cancelled **due to** lack of interest
>- I couldn’t enjoy the meal **owing to** their constant arguing. 
>- We bought this house partly **on account of** the big shed in the back garden.
