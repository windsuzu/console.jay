## Predictions
We use **"will"** to make a prediction with little evidence; for instance, when we **think** something **will** happen. On the other hand, we use **"be going to"** to make a prediction when we have seen some evidence, such as when we **see** something **is going to** happen.

For example:
- We need to hurry up. **We’ll be late** for the conference. 
	- (=I **think** we will be late)
- The conference starts in 10 minutes. We **are going to be** late. 
	- (=I can **see** that we cannot be at the conference in 10 minutes)

## Intetions or Decisions
We use **"will"** for immediate intentions or decisions, typically in the moment of speaking without prior planning. On the other hand, we use **"be going to"** when we've already made a decision in our mind or when there is a pre-existing plan or intention.

For example:
- ‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Oh, I didn’t know. I’**ll call her** in a minute.’
	- (=The decision was taken **while** having this conversation)
- ‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Yes, I know. I’**m going to call her** in a minute.‘
	- (=The decision was taken **before** having this conversation)
