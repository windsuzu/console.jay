Applicant tracking systems (ATS) often filter resumes based on keywords. To increase your chances of getting noticed, strategically ==include relevant keywords== throughout your resume that accurately describe your skills and experience for the specific job.

For relevant keywords, copy the job description into a word cloud generator (e.g., [Free Word Cloud Generator](https://monkeylearn.com/word-cloud/)) and use the generated terms in your resume.

**Also, don't forget to highlight soft skills on your resume!** Search online for "[best soft skills list](https://www.google.com/search?q=best%20soft%20skills%20list)" to identify terms that best reflect your personality. Then, incorporate these skills into your resume's skills section.
