There are 15 main vowel sounds in English^[Ohata, K. (2004). Phonological differences between Japanese and English: Several potentially problematic areas of pronunciation for Japanese ESL/EFL learners. Asian EFL Journal, retrieved on 20th, July, 2012, from http://www.asian-efl-journal.com/ december_04_KO.php], while Chinese has only 5^[San, D. (2007). The phonology of standard Chinese (2nd edition). New York: Oxford University Press.]. This is why Chinese speakers, like me, tend to pronounce English using only the sounds familiar in our native language.

This sometimes results in similar words being pronounced the same way. For example: "heel" and "hill", "sale" and "sell". But don't worry, this can be practiced by **listening to and speaking the two sounds simultaneously**.

## /i/ (heat) and /ɪ/ (hit)
Based on this [accent tutorial by Lisa Mojsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dasuQ9u8i0), we learn that the sounds `/i/`, and `/ɪ/` differ not only in length but also in other aspects. ==When pronouncing `/i/`, we use more tension in our lips and tongue, whereas when pronouncing `/ɪ/`, it's relaxed and neutral with relaxed lips and tongue.== (You can place your fingers on your jaw and cheeks to feel the difference) After understanding the techniques, you can proceed to the practice below.
1. heel - hill
2. feel - fill
6. sheet - shit
3. seat - sit
4. eat - it
5. beach - bitch

## /eɪ/ (sale) and /ɛ/ (sell)


1. bed - bade
2. tell - tale
3. men - main
4. test - taste
5. pen - pain
6. sent - saint
