There are 15 main vowel sounds in English^[Ohata, K. (2004). Phonological differences between Japanese and English: Several potentially problematic areas of pronunciation for Japanese ESL/EFL learners. Asian EFL Journal, retrieved on 20th, July, 2012, from http://www.asian-efl-journal.com/ december_04_KO.php], while Chinese has only 5^[San, D. (2007). The phonology of standard Chinese (2nd edition). New York: Oxford University Press.]. This is why Chinese speakers, like me, tend to pronounce English using only the sounds familiar in our native language.

This sometimes results in similar words being pronounced the same way. For example: "heel" and "hill", "sale" and "sell". But don't worry, this can be practiced by **listening to and speaking the two sounds simultaneously**.

## /i/ (heat) and /ɪ/ (hit)
Based on this [accent tutorial by Lisa Mojsin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dasuQ9u8i0), we learn that the sounds `/i/`, and `/ɪ/` differ not only in length but also in other aspects. ==When pronouncing `/i/`, we use more tension in our lips and tongue, whereas when pronouncing `/ɪ/`, it's relaxed and neutral with relaxed lips and tongue.== (You can place your fingers on your jaw and cheeks to feel the difference) After understanding the techniques, you can proceed to the practice below.
1. heel - hill
2. feel - fill
6. sheet - shit
3. seat - sit
4. eat - it
5. beach - bitch

## /ɛ/ (sell) and /eɪ/ (sale)
According to this [tutorial by Tarle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqN3kGMLwio), we should pronounce `/ɛ/` with tense lips, a narrow mouth opening, and a short vowel sound. For `/eɪ/`, use a more open mouth and a longer vowel sound.
1. bed - bade
2. tell - tale
3. men - main
4. test - taste
5. pen - pain
6. sent - saint

## /æ/ (bad) and /ɛ/ (bed)
Based on tutorials by [Rachel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM9gPzKs1Hg) and [Molly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNL5BmWQGiI), we learn that `/æ/` involves the back part of the tongue towards the roof of the mouth, a more pronounced jaw drop, and a slight lift of the top lip. In contrast, `/ɛ/` uses the mid/front part of the tongue towards the roof of the mouth, with less jaw drop and relaxed lips.
1. man - men
2. sad - said
3. sat - set
4. dad - dead
5. land - lend
6. band - bend
---
## /æ/ (hat) and /ɑ/ (hot)
Taught by [Ronnie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMJrIzjnmDM), to pronounce `/æ/`, you should relax your mouth and open it slightly. On the other hand, to pronounce `/ɑ/`, your mouth should be quite open and loose.
1. bag - bog
2. Dan - Don
3. caps - cops
4. cat - cot
5. sack - sock
---
## /ɑ/ (calm) and /ɘ/ (come)
In [DVCESL72's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_7GJ34UYVE), he teaches us that the `/ə/` sound is easily produced by initially closing the mouth and vibrating it, followed by opening the mouth without altering the shape of your mouth and tongue.

1. sob - sub
2. hot - hut
3. got - gut
4. rot - rut
---
## **/æ/ (bat) and /ɘ (but)**
For more pairing examples, watch [English Pronunciation: Bat /æ/ vs But /Ʌ/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtbewuEu9E4).
1. cap - cup
2. mad - mud
3. ban - bun
4. stack - stuck
---
## /ɔ/ (want) and /oʊ/ (won’t)


---
## /ʊ/ (full) and /u/ (fool)

---

## /ɑ/ (lock) VS. /ɘ/ (luck) VS. /ʊ/ (look)

---
## /ɘr/ (heard) and /ɑ/ (hard)

---

## /ɘr/ (work) and /ɔ/ (walk)

---

## /aɪ/ (time, nine, dry, etc.)


---

## /aʊ/ (south, house, cow, etc.)


---

## /ɔɪ/ (oil, choice, voice, etc.)
