Pattern matching is a [[Imperative and Declarative Programming|declarative]] code-branching technique that manages multiple states without relying on [[Imperative and Declarative Programming|imperative constructs]] like `if`, `else`, or `switch`. While widely implemented in languages well-supported for [[functional programming]], such as Swift, Haskell, and Rust, it is still in the early stages of consideration for addition to EcmaScript (as of 2023). 

Fortunately, the library [ts-pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) provides a means to implement pattern matching with features like **type-safety, exhaustiveness checking**, and more. 

In this note, we are going to demonstrate how you can integrate **pattern matching** into your standard state management code in React JSX components.

## ðŸ”´ Ternaries

Let's examine how we typically implement a component with an API response. Ternaries are undoubtedly a default approach that a React developer would use when handling various statuses from an API response. 

However, there are two drawbacks to the approach of using ternaries:
1. It can be messy, especially when dealing with nested conditions.
2. It cannot accommodate all cases when new states or conditions are added.

```tsx
type State =
  | { status: "loading" }
  | { status: "error"; error: string }
  | { status: "success"; data: string };

const SomeComponent = ({ fetchState }: { fetchState: State }) => (
	<div>
		{fetchState.status === "loading" ? (
		  <p>Loading...</p>
		) : fetchState.status === "success" ? (
		  <p>{fetchState.data}</p>
		) : fetchState.status === "error" ? (
		  <p>Oops, an error occured: {fetchState.error}</p>
		) : null}
	</div>
);
```

## ðŸŸ  Switch + IIFE +  Exhaustiveness Checking
We can use a `switch` statement to make the code look cleaner, but it will always require the use of an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) since a switch statement is not an expression that can be used directly in JSX in React.

Additionally, we can create a function named `safeGuard`, which takes an argument with the type `never`. This ensures that the argument passed to the default branch of the `switch` statement has been narrowed down to `never`, indicating that we have handled all possible `status` values from the API response.

```tsx {3,15,16}
// This function is just a way to tell TypeScript that this code
// should never be executed.
function safeGuard(arg: never) {}

const SomeComponent = ({ fetchState }: { fetchState: State }) => (
	<div>
	  {(() => {
	    switch (fetchState.status) {
	      case "loading":
	        return <p>Loading...</p>;
	      case "success":
	        return <p>{fetchState.data}</p>;
	      case "error":
	        return <p>Oops, an error occured: {fetchState.error}</p>;
	      default:
	        safeGuard(fetchState.status);
	    }
	  })()}
	</div>
);
```

## ðŸŸ¢ ts-pattern


```tsx
import { match } from 'ts-pattern';

const SomeComponent = ({ fetchState }: { fetchState: State }) => (
	<div>
	  {match(fetchState)
	    .with({ status: "loading" }, () => <p>Loading...</p>)
	    .with({ status: "success" }, ({ data }) => <p>{data}</p>)
	    .with({ status: "error" }, () => <p>Oops, an error occured</p>)
	    .exhaustive()}
	</div>;
);
```
