Before ES6, JavaScript used functions and the [[Prototype]] property to share methods across instances, which is known as [[Pseudoclassical Instantiation (new keyword)]]. This approach required understanding the nuances of JavaScript’s prototype chain and constructor functions.




The `class` keyword introduced in ES6 is syntactical sugar over the Pseudoclassical pattern. It offers a cleaner and more intuitive way to define a class’s constructor and its prototype methods. It aligns with the class-based inheritance found in other languages, making JavaScript more accessible to a broader range of developers and improving code readability and maintainability.
