Pattern matching is a [[Imperative and Declarative Programming|declarative]] code-branching technique that manages multiple states without relying on [[Imperative and Declarative Programming|imperative constructs]] like `if`, `else`, or `switch`. While widely implemented in languages well-supported for [[functional programming]], such as Swift, Haskell, and Rust, it is still in the early stages of consideration for addition to EcmaScript (as of 2023). 

Fortunately, the library [ts-pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) provides a means to implement pattern matching with features like type-safety, exhaustiveness checking, and more.
