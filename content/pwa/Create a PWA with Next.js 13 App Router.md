After learning about [[PWA (Progressive Web Apps)]] and [[Create a PWA]], I believe it's a valuable skill to explore creating a PWA with Next.js 13 and the app router. However, the article is limited (Most online tutorials are outdated if you want to use the app router feature^[[How to Create a PWA With Next.js in 10 Minutes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARNN_zmrwcw)]), and it appears that the well-known library `next-pwa` is no longer actively maintained.

The problems you might encounter when implementing a PWA using outdated tutorials often revolve around service worker compatibility or requirements such as `pages` folder, as mentioned in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/16guio3/does_anyone_know_of_a_good_guide_to_setting_up_a/). However, comments in this post also suggest trying [`@ducanh2912/next-pwa`](https://github.com/DuCanhGH/next-pwa), a forked version of `next-pwa` that is compatible with App Router.
