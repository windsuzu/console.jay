PWAs aim to provide a user experience similar to that of native mobile apps, offering features like ==push notifications, offline mode, camera access, and GPS==, which web developers couldn't access before 2020.

After your web apps become PWAs, you can enjoy several key advantages:
1. PWAs can be installed as native apps
2. PWAs can interact with device features like the camera or notifications
3. PWAs can be published to Google Play or Microsoft Store
